# pwdManager
I realized how necessary a password manager was nowadays, and i didn't want to pay one nor trust google, so i decided to create one.

This was done with Python and Kivy and is really just intended to be an offline, secure method of keeping your passwords. Encryption will be added.

My plan is to make an actual browser extension for this so as to be more practical, but this should fill the gap until then.

And hey, it's FOSS!
